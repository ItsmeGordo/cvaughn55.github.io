<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm Christian Vaughn, a guy who occasionally makes video games and other random programs.</p>

<p>I have always been interested in game development and programming, but didnt start messing around with that stuff till around 2013. I found a game engine called <a href="http://www.stencyl.com/">Stencyl</a> which is a neat game engine for beginers since it has easy to understand block code, and a great community filled with demos and tutorials </p>

<p>Since then I have been Messing around with various game ideas in Stencyl and Unity while currently persuing a Computer Science degree, and also doing various other programming projects. I hope to someday make a larger scale game that is more fleshed out and polished than the flash games I have made in the past.  </p>
